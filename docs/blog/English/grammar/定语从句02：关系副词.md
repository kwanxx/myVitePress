## 疑问

📝 which 和 where 区别？注意动词

The place is **which** they want to **visit** is beautiful. （which指place）

The place is **where** they want to **go** is beautiful. （where指there）

（1）go是不及物动词，可以加副词或不加

go + 副词（包括介词短语）

go the place❌（go+副词）

go there✔

go **to school** ✔（介词短语可以作副词）

（2）visit是及物动词，visit + 宾语（名词、代词，不是副词）

visit there❌（there是副词）

visit the place.✔

visit it.✔

> 可以看看第二句型、第三句型，不及物动词

## 回顾一下

关系代词修饰先行词，起连词和副词作用

关系代词是**which**，先行词（人、物体、动物）就是要用which代替的名词。

❗❗代替的先行词是代词，关系代词的定语从句句子不一定完整。

例如：There is the factory **which** produces bicycle. （从句缺主语）

关系代词的用法，例如：

**and / which / in which / that**  代替 **the place**

There are the place.

I was born **in the place.**

（1）用and连起来就是：

There are the place **and** I was born in the place. 

（这是我出生的地方。）

（2）用which连起来就是：

There are the place **which** I was born **in** . 📌不能漏掉介词in

或者，介词可以放在which前面：

There are the place **in which** I was born. 📌不能漏掉介词in

（3）that作**主格**（I 、they、we、 you）、**宾格**（him、her、them），可以代替**which**:

There are the place **that** I was born .📌不用加介词in



## 主要内容



## **关系副词**

作时间、地点、理由、方法这些先行词的关系副词，代替的先行词是副词

❗❗关系副词后面的句子是**完整句子**。

------



## 1.where 关系副词

例：**and / where / that**  代替 **there**（副词）

There are the place.

I was born **there**.

（1）用**and**连起来就是：

There are the place **and** I was born **there**.

（这是我出生的地方。）

（2）用**where**连起来就是：

There are the place **where** I was born   📌代替**there**

（3）**that**作**主格**、**宾格**，可以代替**where**:

There are the place **that** I was born .



> 📝如何判断用which，还是where？
>
> 1.看是否特指地点；
>
> 2.看定语从句的完整性：
>
> （1）There is the factory **which** produces bicycle.
>
> produces bicycle 缺主语，所以用which
>
> （2）There are the place where he works.
>
> he works是完整的句子，所以用where

## 2.when 关系副词 时间

📝 then可以表示：**当时**，**在那时**，于是，接着，而且，另外的意思。

**when**可以代替**at that time \  then**，表示时间的副词

Sunday is a day.

We don't go to school then.

（1）用 **and**连词：

Sunday is a day **and** we don't go to school then.

（2）用 **which**代替**then**

Sunday is a day **which** we don't go to school .

（3）用**when** 代替**then**

Sunday is a day **when** we don't go to school .

## 3.why 关系副词 原因

先行词表达理由、原因，用why

There is the reason.

He was late for school for that reason.

（1）用 **and**连词：

There is the reason **and** he was late for school for that reason.

（2）用 **which** 

There is the reason **which** he was late for school  .

（3）用**why** 代替**for that reason.**

There is the reason **why** he was late for school  .

------



## 4.how 关系副词 方法

先行词表达方法，用how ，但是how 不能同时与 the way用。

❗❗关系副词how后面的句子是完整句子。

There is **the way**.

She solved the problem **in the way**.

（1）用 **and**连词：

There is the way **and** she solved the problem in the way.

（2）用 **which** 

There is the way **which** she solved the problem **in**.📌不能漏介词in

或介词放关系代词前面：

There is the way  in which she solved the problem.

（3）the way不能与how连用，可以用**that代替**：

There is the way **that** she solved the problem.

------



## 非限定性\限定性关系副词

📌非限定性、限定性关系副词区别：加逗号，表达意思不同

**限定性**：I went to  Tokyo where I meet a girl .

**非限定性**：I went to  Tokyo **,**  where I meet a girl .



逗号+关系副词 可以转 连词(and / but ) + 副词（there ）

逗号+关系副词 ：I went to America **, where** broke out the war.

连词 + 副词： I went to America **and there** broke out the war.
